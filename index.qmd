Welcome on the home page of *Extreme Value Analysis* 2027 (EVA 2027). EVA is a biennial international conference on extreme value analysis, probabilistic and statistical models and their applications. The 15th edition  will be hosted by [HEC Montréal](www.hec.ca) in downtown Montréal (Québec, Canada) at the [Hélène-Desmarais building](https://www.hec.ca/en/campus/helene-desmarais/index.html) from Monday July 5th until Friday July 9th, 2027.
